## Full Context

The goal was to provide an intuitive interface for users to upload CSV data and generate various types of interactive charts (bar, line, scatter). Emphasis was placed on performance handling large datasets.

## Tool Details

*   **React:** Managed application state, component lifecycle, and user interactions.
*   **D3.js:** Handled the core SVG chart generation and data binding.
*   **TypeScript:** Added static typing for better code maintainability and catching errors early.
*   **Vercel:** Used for seamless deployment and hosting.
