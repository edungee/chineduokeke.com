## Full Context

This project aimed to create a simple, fast, and easily maintainable personal website to showcase my profile and projects beyond LinkedIn. Key requirements included responsiveness, dark mode, and SEO optimization.

## Tool Details

*   **Next.js:** Utilized the App Router for structure and Server Components for performance. Static Site Generation (SSG) was employed for most pages.
*   **React:** Core library for building UI components.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Used for all styling, leveraging its utility-first approach for rapid development and maintainability.
*   **TypeScript:** Ensured type safety throughout the codebase.
